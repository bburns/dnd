Ability Modifiers range from -5 to +10. They are used more often than the raw [[Ability Score|Ability Scores]] on which they are based. 

Ability Modifier = floor((Ability Score - 10) / 2)

e.g. if Strength = 13 then "Strength Modifier" = +1

# Advantage / Disadvantage #
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sometimes you have a better chance of succeeding at something - this is called having Advantage - e.g. an attack roll made within 5 feet of a Prone creature has Advantage. 

If some source gives you Advantage, roll twice and take the higher of the two rolls - if some source gives you Disadvantage, take the lower score.

Some character [[Class|Classes]] have the ability to cast spells - as they reach higher [[Level|Levels]] they are able to learn more powerful spells (as indicated by the Spell Level). 

Wizards record their spells in a Spellbook (see ph113 for how many spells of each Spell Level they are allowed). For example, a first level Wizard can record two spells of Spell Level 1. 

Casting a spell requires Preparing it first - you can prepare a number of spells equal to your Intelligence [[Ability Modifier]] + Wizard [[Level]]. For example, a first level Wizard with an Intelligence of 16 has an Intelligence Modifier of 3, so at first Level they could prepare 4 spells for use. 

Each time you cast a spell you expend a Slot of the spell's level or higher. To regain all spell slots the character can complete a [[Rest|Long Rest]]. 

Some Spells are Rituals and can be cast without preparation.
