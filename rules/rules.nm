Sometimes you have a better chance of succeeding at something - this is called having Advantage - e.g. an attack roll made within 5 feet of a Prone creature has Advantage. 

If some source gives you Advantage, roll twice and take the higher of the two rolls - if some source gives you Disadvantage, take the lower score.

Can use for Attack Rolls, [[Ability Check|Ability Checks]], [[Saving Throw|Saving Throws]] in various situations.
